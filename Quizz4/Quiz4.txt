     The second part of the test, you should electronically submit, you will need to copy and paste 
     only those lines of code to implement that part of the test, usually a few (two to eight) lines of code. 
     Place it immediately after the question.

     Submit this Quiz (renamed) with code cut and pasted, ONLY text. DO NOT submit zips, binaries, libraries,
     or anything other than text.

     If you understand and agree, please initial here:
     _____AM________

 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*csv, not this quiz) to cloud service. 
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 To recieve credit you MUST show (demo) AND submit the code (text only) on Canvas.

  5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name,
     and below that, Student ID at the top of every web page dispayed 
     (for this quiz). 
     Please use a large font.
    
     The cloud service providers are IBM Cloud (BlueMix), Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS. You may use any you wish.

    Import the datasets into a Relational Data Base (SQL), if you have already done this, (briefly) explain/describe
    how you did this. Please note that for some parts of the following you will need to create indexes (keys)
    appropriately.

  6. Please show a page, followed by a vertical bar chart on that page, where the user, through a web form, 
     will give a country name (column C), then you will display a bar chart with labels (volcano name) 
     on the top of each bar for each volcano in that country.

@application.route('/barChart', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def barChart1():
    country = request.form['country']
    col1 = [['Country','Volcano',{'role':'style'}]]
    connection = sql.connect("quakes.db")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = "select VolcanoName,Elev from volcano where Country = '" + str(country) +"'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    col = cursor.fetchall()
    t_c = len(col)
    i=0
    while(i<t_c):
        random_number = random.randint(0,16777215)
        h_n = str(hex(random_number))
        h_n ='#'+ h_n[2:]
        col1.append([ col[i][0], col[i][1], h_n ])
        i=i+1
    cursor.close()
    return render_template('barChart.html', col1=col1)
@application.route('/Question6')
def Question6():
    return render_template('barChart.html')




  7. Allow a user, through a web form, to give an elevation range and a number of slices N,
     and in a pie chart show the total number of volcanos for each of N pie slices (there should be N pie slices)
     evenly divided into groups of elevations. (For example from 1000 to 5000, and a number of slices N = 4
     show 4 slices, the first for elevation 1000 to 2000 has 99 volcanos out of the 191 total in that range, 
     more than half.)
     The pie chart should occupy 70 to 85% of the screen, each slice with labels inside the slice, 
     each in a different color.

@application.route('/pieChart', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def PieChart():
    fromElev = int(request.form['elev1'])
    toElev = int(request.form['elev2'])
    division = int(request.form['div1'])
    t_c = 0
    col1 = [['Elev','No Of Country',{'role':'style'}]]
    connection = sql.connect("quakes.db")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    d = (float(toElev) - float(fromElev)) / float(division)
    division = int(division)
    fromElev = float(fromElev)
    while int(division) > 0:
        query = "select * from volcano where Elev >= " + str(fromElev) + " and Elev < " + str(float(fromElev) + float(d)) + ""
        cursor.execute(query)
        col = cursor.fetchall()
        magR = str(fromElev) + " to " + str(float(fromElev) + float(d))
        t_c = len(col)
        random_number = random.randint(0,16777215)
        h_n = str(hex(random_number))
        h_n ='#'+ h_n[2:]
        col1.append([ magR, t_c, h_n ])
        division -= 1
        fromElev += d

    cursor.close()

    return render_template('pieChart.html', col1=col1)

@application.route('/Question7')
def Question7():
    return render_template('pieChart.html')


<script>
    google.charts.load('current', {packages: ['corechart', 'bar']});
    google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawStacked);

function drawStacked() {
    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable({{col1 | safe }} );
    var options = {
        //title: 'Motivation and Energy Level Throughout the Day',
        chartArea: {width: '200%',height:'200%'},
        annotations: {
          alwaysOutside: true,
          textStyle: {
            fontSize: 14,
            color: '#000',
            auraColor: 'none'
          }
        },
        hAxis: {
        },
        vAxis: {
        }
      };
      var chart2 = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('pie_div1'));
      chart2.draw(data,options);
    }
</script>


  8. Allow a user, through a web form, to give a volcano number range (for example 40000 to 41000),
     and show a point chart (scatter diagram) where the X axis is the volcano number and the Y axis 
     is the elevation.
     (Please note that a few of the volcanos are under water or ground, so the elevation may be negative.) 
     Please scale so that it fits on the screen, occupying between 70 to 80% of the screen width.
     Please label both axis.

@application.route('/scatterChart', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def ScatterChart():
    fromNum1 = int(request.form['vn1'])
    toNum2 = int(request.form['vn2'])
    t_c = 0
    col1 = [['Volcano range','Elevation',{'role':'style'}]]
    connection = sql.connect("quakes.db")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    
    query = "select Number,Elev from volcano where Number >= '" + str(fromNum1) + "' and Number < '" + str(float(toNum2)) + "'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    col = cursor.fetchall()
    t_c=len(col)
    i=0
    while(i<t_c):
        #magR = str(fromNum1) + " to " + str(float(toNum2))
        random_number = random.randint(0,16777215)
        h_n = str(hex(random_number))
        h_n ='#'+ h_n[2:]
        col1.append([ col[i][0] , col[i][1], h_n ])
        i=i+1

    cursor.close()
    return render_template('ScatterChart.html', col1=col1)
@application.route('/Question8')
def Question8():
    return render_template('ScatterChart.html')



 9. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 6, 7, 8

 10. When complete, return (send) this quiz
     If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
     the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.
