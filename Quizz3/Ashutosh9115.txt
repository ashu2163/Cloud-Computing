     This is a timed test. Late tests will have points deducted for being late.
     Very late tests will not be graded.

     When you are complete, with any part, please send the link, raise your hand, so we may visually inspect that part.

     The second part of the test, you should electronically submit, you will need to copy and paste 
     only those lines of code to implement that part of the test, usually a few (two to eight) lines of code. 
     Place it immediately after the question.

     Submit this Quiz (renamed) with code cut and pasted, ONLY text. DO NOT submit zips, binaries, libraries,
     or anything other than text.

     When any parts(questions) are complete complete, submit this test, you may make multiple submissions.

     If you have computer, or other, problems, please raise your hand immediately.

     If you understand and agree, please initial here:
     ________AM_________

 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*csv, not this quiz) to cloud service. 
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 To recieve credit you MUST show (demo) AND submit the code (text only) on Canvas.

  5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name,
     and below that, Student ID at the top of every web page dispayed 
     (for this quiz). 
     Please use a large font.
    
     The cloud service providers are IBM Cloud (BlueMix), Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS. You may use any you wish.

    Import the datasets into a Relational Data Base (SQL), if you have already done this, (briefly) explain/describe
    how you did this. Please note that for some parts of the following you will need to create indexes (keys)
    appropriately.

Database Connection:
import pyodbc
import os

server = 'ashuapp.database.windows.net'
database = 'ashudb'
username = 'Ashu2163'
password = 'Abcd1234'
driver= '{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}'
dbConnect = pyodbc.connect('DRIVER='+driver+';PORT=1433;SERVER='+server+';DATABASE='+database+';UID='+username+';PWD='+ password)

  6. Allow a user, through a web form, to give a nst range (for example 80 to 85), and show us the matching result tuples
     for that request. (Show nst, lat, long, place, mag, id)
     Show us the time taken to perform that operation.
@app.route("/nstrange", methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def nstrange():
    nst1 = int(request.form['nst1'])
    nst2 = int(request.form['nst2'])
    cursor = dbConnect.cursor()
    #magVal = random.randint(1, 6)
    s=time()
    query = query = "SELECT q.id,l.latitude, l.longitude, l.place, q.mag, q.nst FROM q, l where q.id=l.id and q.nst  >= \'" + str(nst1) + "\' AND q.nst <= \'" + str(nst2) + "\'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    row2 = cursor.fetchall()
    e = time()-s
    #Time = e - s
    #print(Time)
    return render_template('q6.html', time=e, row2=row2)


  7. Allow a user to give a nst range (for example 80 to 85), and you will generate a random select within that nst range,
     select all quakes with that nst value, show us the result, as in the previous question.
     Show us the nst value generated, then show the results.
     Show us the time taken to perform that operation.
@app.route("/nstrange1", methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def nstrange1():
    nst1 = int(request.form['nst1'])
    nst2 = int(request.form['nst2'])
    cursor = dbConnect.cursor()
    rannst = random.randint(nst1, nst2)
    s=time()
    query = query = "SELECT q.id,l.latitude, l.longitude, l.place, q.mag, q.nst FROM q, l where q.id=l.id and q.nst  = \'" + str(rannst) + "\'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    row2 = cursor.fetchall()
    e = time()-s
    #Time = e - s
    #print(Time)
    return render_template('q7.html', time=e, row2=row2)

     
  8. Modify part 7, to allow a value N (up to 500), and repeat the selections N times.
     Show time taken for each, and for all operations.
@app.route("/nstrange2", methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def nstrange2():
    nst1 = int(request.form['nst1'])
    nst2 = int(request.form['nst2'])
    num=int(request.form['num'])
    cursor = dbConnect.cursor()
    s=time()
    times=[]
    rows=[]
    for i in range(num):
        s1=time()
        rannst = random.randint(nst1, nst2)
        query = query = "SELECT q.id,l.latitude, l.longitude, l.place, q.mag, q.nst FROM q, l where q.id=l.id and q.nst  = \'" + str(rannst) + "\'"
        cursor.execute(query)
        row2 = cursor.fetchall()
        rows.extend(row2)
        e1=time()-s1
        times.append(e1)
    e = time()-s    
    return render_template('q8.html', time=e, row2=row2,times=times)

	

  9. Repeat 8. using an in-memory caching mechanism (NOT an in-memory database) repeat the previous step, then show us.

r = redis.StrictRedis(host='newapp1.redis.cache.windows.net', port=6380, db=0, password='U0Uh+fEtxuRma2n8BzDarKXqckC3N3KaSLkLKNhtY34=', ssl=True)

@app.route("/nstrange3", methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def nstrange3():
    nst1 = int(request.form['nst1'])
    nst2 = int(request.form['nst2'])
    num=int(request.form['num'])
    cursor = dbConnect.cursor()
    s = time()
    for i in range(num):
        rannst = random.randint(nst1, nst2)
        query = query = "SELECT q.id,l.latitude, l.longitude, l.place, q.mag, q.nst FROM q, l where q.id=l.id and q.nst  = \'" + str(rannst) + "\'"
        cursor.execute(query)
        row2 = cursor.fetchall()
    e = time()-s

    s1 = time()
    for i in range(num):
        rannst = random.randint(nst1, nst2)
        rkey = 'query1_' + str(rannst)
        if (not r.get(rkey)):
            query = query = "SELECT q.id,l.latitude, l.longitude, l.place, q.mag, q.nst FROM q, l where q.id=l.id and q.nst  = \'" + str(rannst) + "\'"
            cursor.execute(query)
            row1 = cursor.fetchall()
            r.set(rkey, query)
    e1 = time()
    Time1 = e1 - s1
    # print(Time1)
    return render_template('q9.html', time=e, row2=row2, time2=Time1)



  10. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 6, 7, 8, 9

  11. When complete, return (send) this quiz
      If you finish early, send this immediately, otherwise send between
      the end of class and no more than 1 minute after that.
