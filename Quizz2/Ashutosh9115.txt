     This is a timed test. Late tests will have points deducted for being late.
     Very late tests will not be graded.

     When you are complete, with any part, please send the link, raise your hand, so we may visually inspect that part.

     The second part of the test, you should electronically submit, you will need to copy and paste 
     only those lines of code to implement that part of the test, usually a few (two to eight) lines of code. 
     Place it immediately after the question.

     Submit this Quiz (renamed) with code cut and pasted, ONLY text. DO NOT submit zips, binaries, libraries,
     or anything other than text.

     When any parts(questions) are complete complete, submit this test, you may make multiple submissions.

     If you have computer, or other, problems, please raise your hand immediately.

     If you understand and agree, please initial here:
     _________AM________

 2. Get files from this same folder.
   
 3. Name your program/submission with your name and last digits of your ID.

 4a. Using the cloud services provider, all functionality possible should be implemented on that provider.
     (Of course, displaying web pages through a browser and the user interface is "local")

 4b. Upload all data files (*jpg and *csv, not this quiz) to cloud service. 
  
Show and submit code, when each part is complete, raise your hand and then show us:

 To recieve credit you MUST show (demo) AND submit the code (text only) on Canvas.

  5. Show a web page and interface (which resides on the cloud provider) with your name,
     and below that, Student ID at the top of every web page dispayed 
     (for this quiz). 
     Please use a large font.
    
     The cloud service provider is either IBM Cloud (BlueMix) or Microsoft Azure.

     On that same page, allow a user to give an id value (such as "ak020921jc6m"), then please show 
     the details of that quake (if it exists), location (lat, long, place name), mag, time, depth.
     If there are any other quakes with the same mag (same mag plus or minus 0.1 mag), please list
     those as well.

    idd= request.form['id']
    connection = sql.connect("quakes.db")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = "select * from q join l where l.id = \'" + str(idd) + "\' and q.id=l.id "
    cursor.execute(query)
    col = cursor.fetchall()
    mag=col[0][3]
    magfrom=mag-0.1
    magto=mag+0.1
    query1 = "select * from q join l where q.id=l.id and q.mag >= '"+ str(magfrom) +"' and q.mag <= '"+ str(magto) +"'"
    cursor.execute(query1)
    col1 = cursor.fetchall()
    print(len(col1[0]))
    col1.extend(col)
    return render_template('selectv.html', col=col1)


	

  6. (Web page) Allow a user to give two location (pair) values (lat and long for two different locations) 
     (those two locations create a boundary, a box) and a depth range (for example from 2 to 20),
     then: display the 3 largest mag quakes within that (bounding) box, please display the id, location (as above),
     the mag, and time.

@app.route('/tworange', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def tworange():
    lat = request.form['latitude1']
    long0 = request.form['longitude1']
    lat1 = request.form['latitude2']
    long1 = request.form['longitude2']
    fromdepth=request.form['fdepth']
    todepth=request.form['tdepth']

    connection = sql.connect("quakes.db")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    if lat>lat1:
        temp=lat1
        lat1=lat
        lat=temp
    if long0 > long1:
        temp=long1
        long1=long0
        long0=temp
    query = "SELECT q.id,l.latitude, l.longitude, q.depth, l.place, q.time, q.mag FROM q join l where q.id=l.id and l.latitude  >= \'" + str(lat) + "\' AND l.latitude <= \'" + str(lat1) + "\' AND l.longitude >= \'" + str(long0) + "\'AND l.longitude <= \'" + str(long1) + "\' and q.depth >= '"+ str(fromdepth)+"' and q.depth <= '"+ str(todepth) +"' order by q.mag desc LIMIT 3 "
    cursor.execute(query)
    #connection.commit()
    out = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    return render_template('tworange.html', out=out)


  7. (Web page), Allow a user to give a part of a location name (for example "Yellowstone" or "Alaska"), 
     and a depth range (for example from 2 to 200), and a distance (for example 550 km), 
     and show the largest magnitude quake (if one exists), within that distance.
     Note, that there may be several locations in Alaska within that given depth range, 
     so list the largest mag quake for each.
     Please display the lat, long, mag, place, depth and date for each.
    
@app.route('/locrecent', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def locrecent():
    loc = request.form['loc']
    fromdepth=request.form['fdepth']
    todepth=request.form['tdepth']
    dist=request.form['dist']
    connection = sql.connect("quakes.db")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query = "SELECT longitude, latitude from l where place LIKE '%"+ str(loc) +"%'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    col = cursor.fetchall()
    north = float(col[0][1]) + float(dist) / 111
    south = float(col[0][1]) - float(dist) / 111
    east = float(col[0][0]) + float(dist) / 111
    west = float(col[0][0]) - float(dist) / 111
    query1 = "SELECT l.latitude, l.longitude, q.mag, l.place, q.depth, q.time FROM q join l where q.id=l.id and l.latitude >= \'" + str(south) + "\' AND l.latitude <= \'" + str(north) + "\' AND l.longitude >= \'" + str(west) + "\'AND l.longitude <= \'" + str(east) + "\' and q.depth >= '"+ str(fromdepth) +"' and q.depth <= '"+ str(todepth) +"' order by mag desc limit 1"
    cursor.execute(query1)
    col = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    return render_template('sal.html', col=col)



  8. (Similar to part 6, with some modification)
     Allow a user to give two location (pair) values (lat and long for two different locations) 
     (those two locations create a boundary, a box), and a value N, then: 
     display the N largest mag quakes within that (bounding) box, (display lat, long, place, mag, time and id)
     then allow a user to choose any of those quakes (displayed) and modify any of the values: 
     lat, long, place, mag, time and id.

@app.route('/latlon', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def latlon():
    lat = request.form['latitude1']
    long0 = request.form['longitude1']
    lat1 = request.form['latitude2']
    long1 = request.form['longitude2']
    nlarge=request.form['n']
    connection = sql.connect("quakes.db")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    if lat>lat1:
        temp=lat1
        lat1=lat
        lat=temp
    if long0 > long1:
        temp=long1
        long1=long0
        long0=temp
    query = "SELECT q.id,l.latitude, l.longitude, q.depth, l.place, q.time, q.mag FROM q join l where q.id=l.id and l.latitude  >= \'" + str(lat) + "\' AND l.latitude <= \'" + str(lat1) + "\' AND l.longitude >= \'" + str(long0) + "\'AND l.longitude <= \'" + str(long1) + "\' order by q.mag desc LIMIT '"+ str(nlarge) +"'"
    cursor.execute(query)
    col = cursor.fetchall()
    cursor.close()
    return render_template('q8.html', col=col)

@app.route('/q8a', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def q8a():
    idd=request.form['id']
    time=request.form['time']
    lat=request.form['latitude']
    lon=request.form['longitude']
    place=request.form['place']
    connection = sql.connect("quakes.db")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    query="Update q set time= '"+ str(time) +"' where q.id= '"+ str(idd) +"'"
    q1="Update l set latitude= '"+ str(lat) +"', longitude= '"+ str(lon) +"', place= '"+ str(place) +"'  where id= '"+ str(idd) +"'"
    col=cursor.execute(query).rowcount
    col1=cursor.execute(q1).rowcount
    connection.commit()
    cursor.close()
    if col:
        return render_template('q8a.html', col1=col)
    else:
        return render_template('q8a.html', entry="Entry not found..")



  9. Show us, in a link, the application running and we will try it out. Only for parts 5, 6, 7, 8

  10. When complete, return (send) this quiz
